## 🛠️ How to Use This Worksheet

1. Copy/paste each prompt exactly as written into Gemini.
2. Read Gemini's response carefully; look for the "why" behind the code.
3. Ask follow-up questions if you don't understand how a specific property changes the look of the page.
4. Document your understanding in the *Think & Record* section.
5. Think of Gemini as your creative director—if your layout looks "squished," ask it how to add some "breathing room."

## 💬 Section 1: The Three Layers of a Box

Every HTML element (like a heading or a paragraph) is actually a rectangular box. To style them, we need to understand the three layers surrounding the content.

### 💬 Prompt 1.1

**Copy and paste this prompt into Gemini:** `I am a beginner web design student. Explain the CSS Box Model using the analogy of a framed picture hanging on a wall. What part of the picture is the **Content**, the **Padding**, the **Border**, and the **Margin**? Please provide a simple CSS code snippet showing all three properties applied to a <div>.`

### 📝 Think & Record

* **In the "picture frame" analogy, which property creates space *inside* the frame so the picture doesn't touch the glass?**
* *Type here...*
* **Which property creates space *outside* the frame so it isn't touching other pictures on the wall?**
* *Type here...*

---

### 💬 Prompt 1.2

**Copy and paste this prompt into Gemini:** `Show me the difference between 'padding: 20px;' and 'margin: 20px;'. If I have a box with a blue background and black text, which property will grow the blue background area, and which one will move the entire blue box away from other elements?`

### 📝 Think & Record

* **Does adding padding make the background color of an element larger or smaller?**
* *Type here...*
* **If two buttons are stuck together side-by-side, should you use margin or padding to push them apart?**
* *Type here...*

## 🛠️ Section 2: Border Basics

The border is the "wall" between your internal space (padding) and your external space (margin).

### 💬 Prompt 2.1

**Copy and paste this prompt into Gemini:** `How do I write the CSS for a border? I heard there are three parts: width, style, and color. Show me a professional example of a 'border' shorthand property and explain what 'solid', 'dashed', and 'dotted' do.`

### 📝 Think & Record

* **What are the three values you need to define a border in a single line of code?**
* *Type here...*
* **What happens if you forget to include the "style" (like 'solid') in your border code? (Ask Gemini to find out!)**
* *Type here...*

## 📋 Section 3: Shorthand & Precision

Sometimes you want the same spacing everywhere; sometimes you only want a gap at the top.

### 💬 Prompt 3.1

**Copy and paste this prompt into Gemini:** `Explain CSS 'shorthand' for margins and padding. If I see 'margin: 10px 20px 10px 20px;', what order do those numbers follow (Top, Bottom, Left, Right)? Is there a faster way to write it if the Top/Bottom are the same and the Left/Right are the same?`

### 📝 Think & Record

* **What is the "Clock Rule" for remembering the order of Top, Right, Bottom, and Left?**
* *Type here...*
* **Why would a developer use 'padding-left' instead of the 4-number shorthand?**
* *Type here...*
